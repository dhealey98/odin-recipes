# odin-recipes

(Before)
This is my first coding project. By the time it is finished, I will have created a basic, albeit working, website displaying recipes for a few of my favorite foods. The skills I will have demonstrated at the end of this project include:
    
    -basic formatting (headings, paragraph structure, bold, italics)
    -tags and attributes
    -linking from the homepage to other pages within the site
    -attaching photos with alternate text for use with assistive technologies
    -creating ordered and unordered lists

(After)
This project was really fun. I look forward to making it look pretty with CSS. While 
making the "cheeseburger" page, just as I was thinking "Hey, this is really fun!", I
ran into a problem with creating the relative link to display the .jpeg file on the 
page. It took nearly 30 minutes for me to catch my mistake, and it drove me crazy.
While programming the page, I had been listening to the soundtrack of one of my favorite movies, and one of the songs features a suspenseful buildup that was playing just as I discovered the problem. What a feeling that was. I was just about ready to 
call it a night and go to bed, but after finding the problem, I was able to continue happily working for a bit longer. Considering I knew absolutley no HTML a couple weeks
ago, I am excited to see how much I can learn in the future, and how far it can take me.
