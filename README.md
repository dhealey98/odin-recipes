# odin-recipes

(Before)
This is my first coding project. By the time it is finished, I will have created a basic, albeit working, website displaying recipes for a few of my favorite foods. The skills I will have demonstrated at the end of this project include:
    
    -basic formatting (headings, paragraph structure, bold, italics)
    -tags and attributes
    -linking from the homepage to other pages within the site
    -attaching photos with alternate text for use with assistive technologies
    -creating ordered and unordered lists
