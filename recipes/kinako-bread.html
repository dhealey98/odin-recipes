        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This is a dish that I first ate while working at a junior high school 
            in Japan. It was included in that day's school lunch, and it was love
            at first bite. I was such a fan that I learned how to make it on my own
            so that I could eat it whenever I wanted.
        </p>
        <p>Kinako is soybean flour. On its own it doesn't taste particularly
            inspiring, but when mixed with other ingredients, like in this recipe,
            it becomes a delightful taste sensation. This, and the ease with which it
            can be prepared make it a handy recipe for breakfast, lunch, or even
            afternoon tea, if you're into that.
