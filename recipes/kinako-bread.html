        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This is a dish that I first ate while working at a junior high school 
            in Japan. It was included in that day's school lunch, and it was love
            at first bite. I was such a fan that I learned how to make it on my own
            so that I could eat it whenever I wanted.
        </p>
        <p>Kinako is soybean flour. On its own it doesn't taste particularly
            inspiring, but when mixed with other ingredients, like in this recipe,
            it becomes a delightful taste sensation. This, and the ease with which it
            can be prepared make it a handy recipe for breakfast, lunch, or even
            afternoon tea, if you're into that.
        </p>
        <h3>Ingredients (makes 1 slice)</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 slice of white bread, preferably cut thick</li>
            <li>2&1/2 tb butter</li>
            <li>2 tb kinako</li>
            <li>1 tb honey</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Instructions</h3>
        <ol>
           <li>Melt 1&1/2 tb butter in a bowl with a microwave. Next, add 
            the honey and kinako and mix until relatively smooth. Allow to sit and 
            stiffen a bit while preparing the bread.
           </li> 
           <li>Spread the remaining 1 tb butter onto both sides of the bread.
            Place into a frying pan on medium heat and flip it occasionally
            until both sides are golden-brown.
           </li>
           <li>Remove the bread from the frying pan and place onto a plate. Spread
            the now somewhat-stiffened kinako spread onto the top side of the 
            bread. For extra texture, a bit more kinako can be sprinkled onto
            the bread.
           </li>
           <li>Enjoy with coffee, tea, or milk!</li>
        </ol>
