        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This is a dish that taught me, a young man with no confidence in the kitchen,
            that cooking is not actually so scary. The craving for fried rice comes without
            warning, so learning to cook it whenever I want made me feel quite accomplished.
        </p>
        <p>This is a very simple and straightforward fried rice dish, however, to the untrained
            tongue, it tastes like something whipped up by a professional. I have no doubt
            that any friends or family for whom you make this fried rice will be very 
            impressed. Enjoy.
        </p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 cup cooked rice, preferably stored in the refrigerator
                for 2-3 days</li>
            <li>1 egg</li>
            <li>1/3 diced white onion</li>
            <li>1/3 cup chopped green onion</li>
            <li>1/4 cup diced carrot</li>
            <li>1/4 cup peas</li>
            <li>1/4 cup diced ham (chicken also works well)</li>
            <li>soy sauce</li>
            <li>sesame oil</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Instructions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Separate the egg's whites from its yolk. Save the yolk, it will
                be used later. Beat the egg whites in a bowl until conisistent. 
                Add the beaten egg white to a frying pan on medium heat and give it
                a light scramble.
            </li>
            <li>Add the onion, carrot, peas, and ham. Add about half of the green 
                onion and save the rest for garnish later. Allow these to simmer in 
                the pan for a few minutes, until the onion has become golden-brown.
            </li>
            <li>Next, add the rice, lump by lump. Use a fork or spoon (or
                whatever utensil you are using to stir the ingredients) to break up
                the lumps of rice. Rice stored in the refrigerator for a few days
                beforehand generally breaks apart more easily. Allow it to simmer, 
                tossing it occasionally, unitl the rice is golden-brown.
            </li>
            <li>Toss the contents of the pan until everything is well-mixed. 
                Add the soy sauce to the pan by running it down the sides of the pan
                into the food, as opposed to pouring it directly onto the food.
                This allows the sauce to briefly caramelize on the hot pan before 
                mixing with the food, bringing out its flavor.
            </li>
            <li> When everything is well-mixed, add a drizzle os sesame oil to the 
                top of the fried rice. Give the rice one or two final tosses and
                then remove it from the heat.
            </li>
            <li>Pack the rice tightly into a small bowl. Flip the bowl onto 
                the plate from which the fried rice will be eaten. The bowl gives the 
                rice a dome shape. Use a spoon to make a small indent on the top 
                of the dome, and place the egg yolk on top. Garnish with the remaining
                green onion.
            </li>
            <li>Enjoy!</li>
        </ol>
